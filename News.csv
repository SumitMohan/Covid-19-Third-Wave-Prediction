"Amid speculations of Covid  s 3rd wave, experts have said that the 2nd wave is not yet over and these small spikes may lead to a   blunted   third wave of the pandemic in the country.The predicted third wave of Covid is likely to be very different from the 2nd wave in India as vaccination will play a major role in stalling the advent of the wave. (PTI)If in any particular area, the number of Covid-19 cases is increasing, it does not matter whether it is the second wave of the pandemic or the third wave as the interventions will be similar, experts said amid ongoing speculations over the 3rd wave of the pandemic which, according to several projections, may hit India in August."
" The wave or cycle is of academic significance only. If cases are rising, it does not matter whether that is a continuation of the second wave or the start of the next wave,  Delhi-based physician epidemiologist and health systems expert Chandrakant Lahariya told PTI. Researchers of IIT Hyderabad and Kanpur, who had predicted the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic, have said the third wave may peak in October. "
"Reacting to this, joint secretary of the Union health ministry Lav Agarwal has said that the second wave is still not over in India as around 40,000 new Covid 19 infections are being recorded every day. "
"There have been several projections and opinions regarding the third wave in India. Here is all we know:Mathematically, the timing of the third wave in India can be predicted and July-August was predicted as the arrival time of the wave while the peak may come in October. The ground situation may be different from the mathematical model as the wave will depend on human behaviour and vaccine coverage. "
"of the third wave will not be like that of the second wave. It will be a  blunted  wave compared to the devastating second wave, Scientist Gautam Menon told PTI. Several states are witnessing a small spike in Covid-19 cases. But this can  t be confirmed as the third wave, experts have opined. This spike can be a result of the lifting of the restrictions soon after the intensity of the second wave lessened. If new variants are more infectious...  "
"The impact of the wave will not be the same across the country, as vaccination coverage, exposure to the virus is different. The severity: Virologist Gagandeep Kang on Covid 3rd wave threat Transmission of the infection has to be stopped as the virus is getting chances to replicate and thus increasing the chance of the emergence of a new variant, Dr Gagandeep Kang explained. Dr Gagandeep Kang said it is difficult to predict Covid-19 waves as they are dependant on many factors.(PTI) Amid apprehension of a fresh wave of the Covid-19 pandemic "
"-- triggered by scientific projections and the sudden increase in the number of daily infections -- India  s top virologist Dr Gagandeep Kang said there are multiple possibilities as a fresh wave will depend on several things, including a new variant, or a new strain of the variant. In every case, the scenario will be different, the virologist said to news agency ANI. Variant and third wave If the new wave is driven by new variants, "
"it will be difficult to predict the number of cases, Dr Kang said. Many experts have earlier said that Covid  s third wave is unlikely to be as, severe as that of the first and the second as the vaccine coverage will play a significant role.  If it  s driven by strains then we know numbers are likely to be low,  Dr Kang said adding that if the new variants are more infectious, then cases can increase at the same pace as the first wave. Seasonal element and third wave The SARS-CoV-2 virus is somewhat dependent on the environment, the virologist said.  "
"We know that this is a virus that is dependent on the environment and I think what we are seeing from certain other parts of the world is that there may be some seasonal elements to this virus. We have to get through another winter and see that how that plays out, in determining how much we see and when,"
"Dr Kang said. Variant and third wave If the new wave is driven by new variants, it will be difficult to predict the number of cases, Dr Kang said. Many experts have earlier said that Covid  s third wave is unlikely to be as severe as that of the first and the second as the vaccine coverage will play a significant role"
". If it  s driven by strains then we know numbers are likely to be low,  Dr Kang said adding that if the new variants are more infectious, then cases can increase at the same pace as the first wave. Transmission of disease and third wave Explaining how replication of the virus is linked with the emergence of a new variant and thereby responsible for a new wave, Dr Kang said as long as the virus is replicating, the chances of a new variant emerging remain high. To stop the virus from replication, the transmission of the infection has to be stopped as replication takes place in the human host.  "
"..if we want to prevent the emergence of a new variant, we also have to prevent transmission of the disease because any amount of replication will continue to be a threat. That is what we are seeing with delta. Newer variants are able to infect people who have been vaccinated,  Dr Kang said. Calling for layered intervention, which involves many aspects, the virologist said that apart from Covid-appropriate behaviour, one should ensure staying at fully ventilated places, avoiding crowded areas etc. India  s 3rd Covid wave likely to begin in August, say forecasters who predicted 2nd wave India might witness the third Covid-19 wave in August with daily cases clocking between 1-1.5 lakh, according to a study conducted by IIT researchers. However, researchers said the third wave is likely to be weaker than the second wave. "
"The third wave of coronavirus is likely to hit India in the month of August and the daily infections are likely to clock between one lakh to 1.5 lakh, according to a study conducted by IIT researchers. "
"The research was conducted by Mathukumalli Vidyasagar and Manindra Agrawal at IIT Hyderabad and IIT Kanpur, respectively, who developed a mathematical model to predict the rise in Covid-19 cases during the third wave in India. Previously, the researchers had accurately predicted the severe second wave in April-May in which thousands of people lost their lives. The country may see a worsening of its outbreak as soon as this month, with the next wave peaking in the best-case scenario with less than 100,000 infections a day, or nearly 150,000 in the worst scenario, "
"the research suggests. States with high Covid-19 rates, such as Kerala and Maharashtra, could  skew the picture , Professor Vidyasagar told Bloomberg in an email. However, the researchers said the likely third wave is expected to be weaker than the second wave, which saw over four lakh daily cases. "
"The forecast by the researchers suggests that the government accelerate the vaccination drive, deploy surveillance methods to catch emerging hotspots and amplify genome sequencing given the potential for new variants to emerge."
"In July, a report published by SBI Research predicted the third wave in India by August which will peak in September. Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) scientist Professor Samiran Panda also told India Today TV that the third wave is likely to come by August-end and India may witness one lakh daily Covid-19 cases. "
"Currently, India has 4,13,718 active Covid-19 cases with recovery rate at 97.35 per cent. However, southern states such as Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka along with Maharashtra are reporting high daily virus cases. "
"While these states account for 83.12 per cent of the new virus cases, with Kerala alone is responsible for 51.65 per cent of the new cases. On the vaccination front, the government has administered over 47 crore doses of Covid-19 vaccines. However, only seven per cent of the population has been fully vaccinated so far. Explained: "
"Is a third wave of Covid-19 in India inevitable? Health authorities have been warning of a possible third wave of Covid-19 infections. What defines a wave in an epidemic, at national and regional levels? How likely is a third wave, and will it be severe? Having failed to adequately prepare for the second wave of coronavirus infections, officials and health authorities are now routinely warning people of the possibility of a third wave."
"It started earlier this month with the Principal Scientific Advisor K VijayRaghavan calling the third wave  inevitable  even though its timing could not be predicted. VijayRaghavan added a caveat two days later, saying a third wave could be avoided through  strong measures , but several others have issued similar warnings in the last couple of weeks. "
Local administrations and some hospitals have already begun ramping up their infrastructure in anticipation of a fresh surge in cases after a few months. What is a wave in an epidemic? There is no textbook definition of what constitutes a wave in an epidemic. The term is used generically to describe the rising and declining trends of infections over a prolonged period of time. The growth curve resembles the shape of a wave. 
"Historically, the term wave used to refer to the seasonality of the disease. Several viral infections are seasonal in nature, and they recur after fixed time intervals. Infections rise and then come down, only to rise again after some time. Covid-19 has continued relentlessly for the last one-and-a-half years, but in every geography, "
"there have been periods of surge that have been followed by a relative lull. In India so far, there have been two very distinct periods of surge, separated by a prolonged lull. Smaller regions within a country, a state or a city, for example, would have their own waves. Delhi, for example, has so far experienced four waves. There are three very distinct peaks in its growth curve even before the current wave, while in states like Rajasthan or Madhya Pradesh, the growth curves had a much more diffused look until February, lacking a sharp peak. It would be difficult to identify distinct waves in such a situation. (See graphs) So, how would one identify a third wave, if it comes? The third wave currently under discussion refers to a possible surge in cases at the national level. The national curve seems to have entered a declining phase now"
"after having peaked on May 6. In the last two weeks, the daily case count has dropped to about 2.6 lakh from the peak of 4.14 lakh, while the active cases have come down to 32.25 lakh, after touching a high of 37.45 lakh. If current trends continue, it is expected that by July, India would reach the same level of case counts as in February. If there is a fresh surge after that, and continues for a few weeks or months, it would get classified as the third wave. In the meantime, states could continue to experience local surges. Like it is happening in Tamil Nadu and Andhra Pradesh right now"
"Or, at a more local level, in the districts of Amravati, Sangli and a few others in Maharashtra. But as long as they are not powerful enough to change the direction of the national curve, they would not be described as the third wave. Also, the more localised the surge, the quicker it is likely to get over, although cities like Mumbai and Pune have gone through prolonged surges. Will the third wave be stronger? There has been some speculation about the third wave being even stronger than the second. However, this is not something that can be predicted. Usually, it is expected that every fresh wave would be weaker than the previous one. That is because the virus, when it emerges, has a relatively free run, "
"considering that the entire population is susceptible. During its subsequent runs, there would be far lower number of susceptible people because some of them would have gained immunity. This logic, however, has been turned on its head in India  s case. When the number of cases began declining in India after mid-September last year, only a very small fraction of the population had got infected. There was no reason for the disease spread to have slowed down,"
"considering that such a large proportion of the population was still susceptible. The reasons for the five-month continuous decline in cases in India is still not very well understood. And since the second wave was expected to be weaker than the first, many were fooled into believing that the pandemic was nearing its end. "
"With the lessons learnt in a very painful manner, there are now suggestions that the third wave might be even stronger. But that might not be the case. A far greater number of people have been infected during the second wave than the first. With the positivity rate almost four times that of the first wave, the unconfirmed infections — those who were never tested — is also expected to be large. In addition, vaccination would also induce immunity in a large proportion of the population. So, there would be a significantly lower number of susceptible people in the population after the second wave. However, gene mutations in the virus can alter these calculations. The virus can mutate in ways that make it escape the immune responses developed in the already infected people, or those vaccinated. But is it inevitable? The third wave is a distinct possibility. It is likely to come, although the scale or timing is not something that can be predicted. But it is not inevitable."
"As mentioned, VijayRaghavan, the Principal Scientific Advisor, also modified his remarks, clarifying that it could possibly be avoided if people continue to take strong measures. It  s also possible that this time, the fresh wave will be indeed much smaller than the previous one, so that it inflicts much less pain and can be managed more efficiently. "
"A lot would depend on how people heed these warnings. They can become paranoid about an incoming disaster, or get numb to repeated warnings. The second wave has taught us that it is far better to remain paranoid and cautious than be hopeful in a situation like this.

"says PM Modi; India gets 5th vaccine to fight Corona as Johnson and Johnson  s single-dose Covid-19 jab receives emergency use approvalCoronavirus Cases in India Latest Update, Covid-19 Vaccine Registration Online, Covid Live Tracker, Covid third wave latest news August 7: More than 50 crore vaccine doses have been in the country with around 43.29 lakh doses administered only on Friday. Talking about the pace of vaccination, Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya said it took India 85 days to vaccinate 10 crore people.  India then took 45 days to touch the figure of 20 crore. "
"In another 24 days, the figure reached 40 crore and in another 20 days we surpassed the figure of 50 crore,  Mandaviya said. The pace of vaccination would improve further if the Drug Controller General of India (DCGI) gives emergency use authorisation (EUA) to single-dose vaccine of Johnson and Johnson. The Serum Institue of India has already applied for the authorisation. The SII has also done it for Covovax vaccine. India reported 38,628 new coronavirus infections in the last 24 hours, taking the overall Covid-19 tally to 3,18,95,385, according to data from the Union health ministry on Saturday. With 617 fresh fatalities, the Covid-19 death toll climbed to 4,27,371, it said."
"The active Covid-19 cases in the country have declined to 4,12,153 and now account for 1.29 per cent of the total infections. Meanwhile, the number of cases being reported from Kerala still remains a cause of concern for health officials. The southern state is still reporting around 20,000 cases almost on a daily basis. Some of the worst affected districts in Kerala are Malappuram, Ernakulam, and Thrissur. Another cause of concern for the government is the rise in the number of cases of Delta variant, which is more dangerous because of its higher transmissibility. Panic gripped the people of Maharashtra  s Nashik after the district recorded thirty cases of the Delta variant altogether. "
"The administration has tightened restrictions in the area and has requested people to follow covid appropriate behaviour. India is likely to see a rise in Covid-19 infections building into a new -- though smaller -- virus wave that may peak in October, according to a mathematical model by researchers who accurately predicted the tapering of a brutal surge of cases earlier this year. The country may see a worsening of its outbreak as soon as this month, with the next wave peaking in the best-case scenario with less than 100,000 infections a day, or nearly 150,000 in the worst scenario, according to estimates by researchers led by Mathukumalli Vidyasagar and Manindra Agrawal at Indian Institute of Technology in Hyderabad and Kanpur respectively. States with high Covid rates, such as Kerala and Maharashtra, could  skew the picture,  "
"Vidyasagar told Bloomberg in an email. The next wave is likely to be far smaller than the second wave that peaked at a record 400,000-plus daily cases on May 7 and declined sharply thereafter. But the forecast still underscores the need for India to accelerate its vaccination campaign, deploy surveillance methods to catch emerging hotspots and stay vigilant through genome sequencing given the potential for new variants to emerge. "
The delta strain now causing renewed outbreaks across the world was first identified in India last October.
"Third wave Experts are concerned about complacency setting in as people resume social and business activity in the face of waning infections. India  s first outbreak last year ebbed with limited damage, leading to a quick resumption of local travel and large-scale festivals that drove the emergence of a devastating second wave in March. With hospitals and crematoriums overwhelmed, researchers estimate that as many as 5 million people may have been killed in that outbreak. The government estimates of total Covid-related fatalities so far is 424,351. That last wave also lead to high levels of natural immunity in the country  s nearly 1.4 billion people -- a factor that could blunt the impact of the next surge. A national antibody survey by the Indian Council of Medical Research study last month found that two-thirds of Indians above the age of six had been exposed to the coronavirus. Next hotspot Five months after the last wave started, daily infections in India have plateaued at around the 40,000 daily mark. For the past five days, roughly half the new cases are coming from the southern state of Kerala, making it potentially the next hotspot. Daily cases have grown persistently through July in Kerala and a few smaller north-eastern states, said Paul Kattuman, professor in the Judge Business School at the University of Cambridge, which has developed a Covid-19 tracker for India. But a few states also saw  short-lived flare-ups in July which abated relatively quickly,"
"  putting the country overall in  a steady state  for now.  If infection begins to increase in a few large states, the present balance will tip, and cases are likely to begin growing again in the country as a whole,  Kattuman said.  We might expect to see a slow-burn in the country for a duration -- this can be expected to last till vaccination coverage is sufficiently high to induce herd immunity.  India has so far administered 470.3 million vaccine doses, but only 7.6% of the population is fully vaccinated, according to Bloomberg  s vaccine tracker. The relatively slow uptake has added to concerns that the country may not be fully geared for the next wave. The central government led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi says it is now better prepared for further outbreaks and that future waves will not have the same impact on the economy as before. "
"Public health authorities need to conduct air and sewage water surveillance to detect virus clusters across city neighborhoods, according to Ram Vishwakarma, an adviser at India  s Council of Scientific & Industrial Research. This would catch potential infections before they escalate to hospital emergency rooms.  Sewage water surveillance is the first indication that you start getting from a particular area,  he said at a conference on July 28. Stepping up public health efforts and avoiding past mistakes will be key if India wants to save lives and livelihoods when the next wave descends."
"This is the period which is the most critical because the next wave is imminent,  Vishwakarma said. Third wave of Corona in India – Precaution needed to Stay Safe at Home are discussed on this page with proper details. The Government of India has recently issued a warning regarding the third wave of corona disease, which has been continuously spreading. The government has stated in unambiguous terms that the third wave of Corona will ensue if the lockdown is not followed well. All the information about the third wave of corona in India is given in the following article. "
"It is estimated that the third wave of corona is more dangerous than the first 2 waves. So far the third wave of Corona has arrived in the country. Like Kerala, its number of patients has increased in other states. Third wave of corona If you talk about experts, now Corona has taken a new form which is being called the Third Wave of Corona. In the following article, what is the problem you may face when you come in contact with it? So far, the country was putting its sari strength in fighting Corona, but now we should prepare ourselves to fight the coming corona third Wave. "
"Researchers have issued warnings about the third wave of the corona. We request you not to leave the house without any urgent work. According to an estimate, the third wave of Corona is considered more dangerous than the 1st and 2nd wave so far. You are requested not to leave the house to save your family from this disease. The government has appealed to stay in the houses in view of the ever-increasing sickness of Corona. "
"According to the government, if you follow the lockdown well, then corona disease will not harm you. No third wave yet, surge in cases continuation of the second one, say expertsThe third wave of Covid-19 has not yet hit India and the ongoing surge in cases in certain regions such as Kerala and northeast India is part of the second wave started by the Delta variant, public health experts have said.  There is no third wave yet. The third wave of Covid-19 has not yet hit India and the ongoing surge in cases in certain regions such as Kerala and northeast India is part of the second wave started by the Delta variant, public health experts have said.  There is no third wave yet. We are still in the late phase of the second wave,  said Anurag Aggarwal, director of CSIR-Institute Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology. "
"He said the second wave reached later in the northeast and has spread more slowly in Kera K Srinath Reddy, president of Public Health Foundation of India (PHFI), said hospitalisation rate could be the most significant indicator of a possible third wave of the pandemic.  There are three indicators that we will have to follow — number (of cases), deaths and hospitalisation. The best indicator is hospitalisation because the other two indicators are vulnerable to undercounting and also because the numbers needing hospitalisation indicate the stress on the health system,  he said. "
"A study by a group of researchers has predicted that the outbreak may worsen as early as this month. The third wave could see 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh daily infections, the group predictedAmid concerns about the rising R-value, rate of vaccination, and easing of lockdown norms, the third wave has arrived at the doorstep of India, as per a report by Bloomberg."
"A smaller wave A study by a group of researchers led by Mathukumalli Vidyasagar and Manindra Agrawal at the Indian Institutes of Technology (IIT) in Hyderabad and Kanpur respectively have predicted that India may see a worsening of its outbreak as soon as this month, with the next wave peaking with less than 100,000 infections a day, in the best-case scenario, or nearly 150,00 in the worst scenario in October. "
"They have, however, pointed out that the third wave is likely to be   smaller   than the second wave, which peaked at a record 400,000-plus daily cases on 7 May, owing to the high levels of natural immunity. A national antibody survey by the Indian Council of Medical Research study last month had found that two-thirds of Indians above the age of six had been exposed to the coronavirus . Meanwhile, the researchers said that states reporting a high number of COVID-19 cases like Kerala and Maharashtra may play a significant role in  skewing  the case count during the third wave. "
"But even then, physical distancing, wearing masks, hand hygiene, and avoiding long periods indoors in poorly ventilated, busy places can still keep the virus at bay, as per the emergencies director of World Health Organisation (WHO) Michael Ryan. No scope for complacency According to doctors problems of the first wave were not the problems of the second wave and the problems of the second wave may not surface in the third wave, as per ET, indicating that there is absolutely no scope for complacency. These predictions and suggestions come in the wake of several states, including Maharashtra and Karanataka, easing lockdown norms; pictures of crowded tourist destinations surfacing on social media, reports of only 7.6 percent population being vaccinated in India and the coronavirus delta variant being declared as contagious as chickenpox. Is India ready? After the new Health Minister Mansukh Mandaviya took charge on 8 July he announced the India "
"COVID-19 Emergency Response and Health System Preparedness Package: Phase-II (ECRP-II) amounting to Rs 23,123 crore for FY 2021-22, 15 percent of which was released on 31 July. It will be used to augment health infrastructure at the state, district and sub-district levels."
"The governments are also better prepared following the first and the second waves. The Centre has also identified 46 districts in 10 states that have logged a positivity rate of above 10 percent. The states are Maharashtra, Kerala, Odisha, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, Mizoram, Assam, Manipur, and Meghalaya. It has asked the states concerned to impose stricter restrictions to curb the rise in infections. Meanwhile, the country has improved its vaccination rates last month by administering 12.9 crore doses in July, compared with 11.27 crore in June, according to data from the government  s CoWin dashboard. An increase of 5,395 cases has been recorded in the active caseload in a span of 24 hours. With 42,625 people testing positive for the coronavirus infection in a day, India  s total tally of COVID-19 cases rose to 3,17,69,132 and the active caseload increased to 4,10,353, according to data updated by the Union Health Ministry on Wednesday."
"The death toll climbed to 4,25,757 with 562 fatalities.

While a large number of people now have immunity against coronavirus due to previous infections or vaccination, a guarded approach is needed in terms of implementing restrictive measures to avoid a second wave-like crisis, experts said. Dr Yudhyavir Singh, who has been managing the COVID-19 ICU at AIIMS New Delhi, said it is important to lift a few restrictions to resume economic activities when cases are low."
" However, one should not lower their guard Adopt a guarded approach in terms of following COVID-19-appropriate behaviour and implementing restrictive measures,  "
"he said. Dr Singh added that Delhi may have already achieved herd immunity, considering the massive number of cases seen during the second wave. However, Dr Pooja Khosla, senior consultant (Department of Medicine), Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, said the second wave of the coronavirus has taught us that cases can increase suddenly.  "
"There are warning signs from different parts of the world. In India too, a small increase in cases has been recorded. Infections can increase exponentially anytime. I think one should not assume anything and make all efforts to prevent a second wave-like crisis, which was a nightmare,  she said.  Opening everything is not appropriate everyone has been saying the third wave is a couple of days away,  Dr Khosla added. Pragya Sharma, professor (Department of Community Medicine) at the Maulana Azad Medical College, said a third wave is a certain thing but the number of people it will infect will depend on the implementation of preventive measures and the pace of vaccination. "
"Even if there are breakthrough infections among vaccinated people, the severity will be less and hospitals will not be overwhelmed,  she said. Sharma thinks the implementation of preventive and restrictive measures is an issue.  People either don  t wear mask or don  t wear it properly. Most of them use cloth mask, which doesn  t serve any purpose. There is hardly any vigil being maintained in crowded areas,  she said."
"After a devastating second wave of the coronavirus, people had started taking vaccination seriously. There would be queues at vaccination centres, but things have changed again. There is laxity on the part of the people, Dr Sharma said.  At the inoculation centre at MAMC, only around 50 people are getting vaccinated a day, while we can vaccinate around 200 people every day. Vaccines are available but people are not coming forward,  she said. "
"Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the Community Medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital, said around 80 per cent of people have immunity against the virus, either due to previous infection or due to vaccination."
"The Delta variant of coronavirus was responsible for up to 60 per cent of the cases during the second wave. We haven  t observed any major difference between   Delta   and   Delta Plus   variant. So, a sudden spike in COVID-19 cases is not expected, until a new, more infectious variant emerges,  he said. Still, there is a percentage of people who have not been infected or did not develop enough antibodies despite getting vaccinated, due to various reasons. "
"This set of people, which is almost 30 per cent of the population in Delhi, is likely to get infected.  Two cases are possible first, the virus continues to infect people slowly until herd immunity is attained, and second, a new, more infectious variant leads to an increase in cases till everyone has immunity. But it seems the third wave won  t be as severe as the second,  he said. With the lifting of restrictions, people from rural areas have started coming to Delhi or those who have remained isolated so far are stepping out.  If such people go to crowded places, then there is a possibility of a spike in cases,  he said."
"There is also a possibility that a new variant bypasses the immunity achieved through vaccination and previous infection. If that happens, it will a huge problem then, Dr Kishore added. Niti Aayog member Dr V K Paul has also told the Delhi government to remain watchful as the next three months are important and unlocking activities can lead to an increase in COVID-19 cases. However, a third wave of COVID-19 is unlikely to be as severe as the second wave, Dr Samiran Panda of the Indian Council of Medical Research had told the Delhi Disaster Management Authority during a meeting on July 9."
"He had mentioned that a substantial third wave would be plausible if any new, more infectious variant of the coronavirus emerges and escapes prior immunity in the absence of adequate lockdown measures. Dr Panda had suggested that vaccination efforts be ramped up to strongly mitigate the impact of a possible third wave. Delhi battled a brutal second wave of the pandemic that claimed a massive number of lives, with the shortage of oxygen at hospitals across the city adding to the woes. On April 20, Delhi had reported 28,395 cases, the highest in the city since the beginning of the pandemic. On April 22 the case positivity rate was 36.2 per cent, the highest so far. The highest number of 448 deaths was reported on May 3."
"The capital has recorded 2,369 cases of the coronavirus in the last 30 days (since June 24), 79 cases a day on an average. India may witness another rise in Covid-19 infections this month (August) with the third wave of corona peaking in October, a mathematical model by researchers predicted. According to estimates by researchers led by Mathukumalli Vidyasagar and Manindra Agrawal at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), in Hyderabad and Kanpur respectively, rising cases will push the third wave with less than 100,000 infections a day in the best-case scenario or nearly 150,000 in the worst scenario,"

On the third wave predictions, the researchers have further said it is not likely to be as brutal as the second wave.  In May, Vidyasagar had said India  s coronavirus outbreak could peak in the coming days based on the mathematical model.   Our predictions are that the peak will come within a few days.

"or nearly 1,50,000 cases a day in the worst scenario.  The predictions on the COVID-19 third wave come from researchers who had Present situation Meanwhile, fresh COVID-19 cases in India registered a week-on-week rise for the first time in 12 weeks since the peak of the second wave in early May. Currently, however, the surge is mainly restricted to Kerala and, to a much lesser degree, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu. Overall, India registered more than 2.86 lakh new cases in the current week (July 26-August 1), a 7.5 per cent rise from the previous week  s tally of 2.66 lakh. Weekly cases in the country have registered a rise for the first time since May 3-9, when the second wave peaked. The fall in cases had continued till last week, even though the decline had slowed to 1.4 per cent. According to the Health Ministry data updated on Monday, India registered 40,134 fresh COVID-19 infections, pushing its virus tally to 3,16,95,958, while the number of active cases registered an increase for the sixth consecutive day.  The death toll from the pandemic climbed to 4,24,773 with 422 daily fatalities. The number of active coronavirus cases has increased to 4,13,718 and comprises 1.31 per cent of the total infections, while the national COVID-19 recovery rate was recorded at 97.35 per cent, the data updated at 8 am showed. An increase of 2,766 cases has been recorded in the active COVID-19 caseload in a span of 24 hours. COVID-19 second wave in India By February 2021, daily cases of COVID-19 in India had fallen to 9,000. However, by early April 2021, a major second wave of infections took hold in the country. "
"On April 9, India surpassed 1 million active cases and by April 12, India overtook Brazil as having the second-most COVID-19 cases worldwide. By late April, India passed 2.5 million active cases and was reporting an average of 300,000 new cases and 2,000 deaths per day. On April 30, India reported over 4,00,000 new cases of coronavirus and over 3,500 deaths in one day. The number of new cases had begun to steadily drop by late May. On May 25, the country reported 195,994 new cases - its lowest daily increase since April 13.  However, the mortality rate has remained high and by May 24, India recorded over 3,00,000 deaths attributed to COVID-19. In May 2021, the World Health Organisation (WHO) had declared that two variants of the coronavirus will be referred to as   Delta   and   Kappa  "
"There have been increasing speculations on the possibility of a third wave of SARS-CoV-2 infection in India. If one responds in affirmative — which I think is a distinct possibility although not inevitable as it is dependent on the scale and quality of appropriate public health measures — the volley of questions that follow are when, how big and how long will it stay? The modelling study we conducted from the Indian Council of Medical Research in collaboration with the Imperial College, London, yielded multiple outcome scenarios in this regard ranging from an onset of a third wave in late August, 2021, to October this year. The time to reach its peak, however, would take four more months and could even go to as far as mid-2022"
"One should, however, note that the peak of the third wave may not be as severe as the second wave and all these possibilities are dependent on a number of factors such as — waning of immunity acquired by us following natural infection or vaccination, emergence of a SARS-CoV-2 mutant that is able to escape the immunity we have acquired so far, emergence of a viral variant, which is more transmissible or easing of restrictions that were instated in some of the States following the second wave that started gaining its momentum in February 2021. Natural immunity is said to last 6-9 months. Through vaccination, people get protection for 9 -12 months. If the second wave peaked in mid-May, then how could a third wave hit so early? First, we need to understand that the different States in the country witnessed a different intensity of infection. During the said second wave of COVID-19 in India, 80% of the caseloads were contributed by about 10 States. "
" So, there is still a large proportion of the population in other States that is vulnerable to catching the infection. Second, when the cases rose to a concerning height in Delhi and Maharashtra and a few other States, these States imposed restrictions to contain the spread of the infection. Drawing upon these examples, the other States where the cases were not so high also imposed similar restrictions, curbing the infection curve at an early stage. But now these States have to be very careful while lifting the restrictions as their population has not been exposed to the virus. Any carelessness can lead to a sharp surge and in such scenario the issue of waning immunity becomes irrelevant as by and large considerable proportions of the individuals in these States did not have exposure to infection and even if they had the first and second wave of infection were small enough to leave a considerable proportion of the State residents vulnerable. A third wave in such a situation can make its appearance felt as early as late August, 2021. Delta variant was the dominant strain during the recent wave. Do you think it will be the emergence of any new mutant that would lead to another surge? There are multiple factors that could contribute to the surge in the number of cases. The CHROMIC (Collaborative Health Research On Modelling by ICMR & Imperial College) model highlighted four such scenarios in this regard. "
"First, the immunity that people developed through the natural infection or vaccine fades away, making people vulnerable to re-infections, second the emergence of a new mutant which is capable of escaping the immunity, third the emergence of a new mutant which is more transmissible and last a surge is possible in States which imposed effective State level lockdown at an early stage during the second wave. These States didn  t allow the Delta variant to spread during the recent outbreak and need to be careful while lifting the restrictions. So, would it be a second wave for these States? Each State needs to characterise the course of SARS-CoV-2 infection progressing within its territory and spreading in its population. "
"Only then it will be possible to assign a number against each of these waves appearing in a State. India is a large country and different parts of the country are in different phases of the COVID-19 epidemic. For example, in Delhi it was not the second wave, rather it was the fourth upsurge and the heights of these waves differed from each other depending on the intensity of spread of infection vis a vis concurrent intervention measures. It is important to appreciate such heterogeneity so that State-specific intervention measures can be appropriately planned. The way to do so is to examine local level data to inform programme and to work with the community to implement interventions. And even think of now, it is told that we are in a declining phase of the second wave in India. That  s the country average, which tells us so. "
"The problem with such averages is that they not only get influenced by extreme values but also by frequent occurrences. But State-level pandemic management plan cannot benefit from such averages as this is an overall country scenario. The virus has not disappeared from the country and while it is maintaining a quieter profile in some corners, somewhere else it is causing havoc. The States in the north-eastern region of the country, for example, or Kerala, are still witnessing the second surge moving upwards or in Maharashtra declining to go down. Understanding the local context, congregations and compulsions are therefore important. Can we prevent future waves? Yes, it can be prevented. But for that, "
"we need to understand that there is no one India when it comes to the spread of the infection. Different regions are in a different phase of the pandemic. Health is a State subject, and so to prevent yet another surge it is important for authorities to assess the situation in different districts and take appropriate district specific measures after a careful epidemiologic analysis. Second, by ramping up the vaccination we can reduce the severity of the disease to a great extent. The CHROMIC model clearly shows how vaccination can help flatten the curve of the third wave at population level. Third, by avoiding the mass congregations — we will be able to take away the opportunity from the virus for spreading. In short, we need to avoid situations that can help the reproduction rate of the virus to go up. And finally, through INSACOG, the government is keeping a vigil on the emergence of new viral variants. Considering such information together with sentinel surveillance data at the district level is the need of the hour. In order to be able to outsmart the virus named SARS-Cov-2, we have to have smart data usage plan that could inform pandemic containment measures at the peripheral outposts in which active engagement of the community is a must. he number of Coronavirus patients is surging once again in many countries. It is also important to note that in many countries, people who have received both doses are also getting infected. Along with this, the biggest danger that lurks at this time is the possibility of a third wave. "
"Health experts and the Central government believe that the coming three months are very crucial. Many questions are also being raised in the expert community including how effective will vaccines be in defending against covid-19 infections? How will the increasing number of patients in foreign countries affect our country? Can this wave of corona be avoided?

"
"Dr Laharia opined that if we all follow the Covid appropriate behaviour then the third wave can be avoided. An expedited vaccination drive can help in avoiding the Covid-19 third wave. New Delhi, India (July 21, 2021) -- India recently reported 3,998 COVID-19 deaths in a single day, the country  s highest death toll in a month, indicating that a third wave is imminent. Some models estimate that India  s total COVID-19 death toll could be 10 to 15 times higher than official government estimates. Thus, single-day deaths may also be much higher than currently reported. With newly diagnosed infections hovering above 40,000 each day, Project HOPE warns that the country must immediately prepare to mitigate the effects of the new wave marked by the wide circulation of the more deadly Delta variant and should continue implementing public health and safety measures. Ray Kancharla, Project HOPE  s team lead in India, issued the following on-the-ground updates:  "
"Prevention is the only cure right now. Though nationally there has been a decline in COVID-19 cases and deaths since the second wave subsided in mid-June, and lockdowns have eased slightly, the recent jump in COVID-19 deaths is a stark reminder that the risk of this virus is not over.  We should avoid repeating the same story of what happened a few months ago. Health care workers are still under incredibly heavy stress. I recently spoke with nursing students from marginalized communities in Southern India who became COVID-19 Care Workers during the pandemic. They didn  t realize the job would come with such immense physical and mental health tolls. During the second wave, health care staff worked 18 hours a day while consulting and monitoring other patients over the phone after hours. Even though their workday has now shortened slightly, the loss of colleagues makes them aware of the ongoing risk of a looming third wave. There are reports that between 600 to 800 doctors lost their lives in the second COVID-19 wave. The best way to honor them is to prioritize supporting those who remain on the frontline.  There are four states where COVID-19 numbers are still very high: Kerala, Karnataka, Tamilnadu and Maharashtra. "
"Telangana and Andhra Pradesh are close in numbers as well. We cannot forget the deadly lack of resources such as oxygen and hospital beds that recently plagued our country. People are now claiming that there is a surplus of these supplies, but the Delta variant could switch that in an instant. A new COVID-19 wave could be even more dangerous with even higher mortality rates. Many are referring to it as COVID-Delta, as the Delta variant takes less time to go to extremes, sometimes without any symptoms. We  ve seen how fast this virus can spread and take lives, so we must emphasize prevention and preparedness before it  s too late.  Project HOPE In India Project HOPE is working with partners across India to bring COVID-19 education and awareness to vulnerable rural and urban slum populations, many of whom do not have access to health facilities, technology and routine care. Project HOPE has reached nearly 3,000 villages with vehicle campaigns to teach people about COVID-19 prevention as public health and safety measures are the main drivers of prevention in vulnerable and marginalized communities. "
"The vehicle campaigns also educate on vaccines and have expanded into the urban population of New Delhi with a goal of reaching one third of the entire region. Project HOPE is supporting Primary Health Care Centres in four states by strengthening their medical equipment infrastructure in advance of a third wave. Pediatric COVID-19 Care Centres are underway, where Project HOPE will teach interventions for how to care for children infected with COVID-19 should a third wave strike. India Inc is better prepared to protect businesses and their employees if an expected third Covid wave were to strike, industry captains said, pointing to the multiple de-risking initiatives deployed after the first two viral episodes that took heavy tolls on livelihoods and lives, respectively.

More information can be found at  Daily coronavirus infections are rising in India again after weeks of steady decline, fuelling anxieties about the threat of a third wave in a country still reeling from the disease  s last devastating surge. The Covid-19 reproduction rate, or the average number of people to whom an infected person transmits the virus, has risen above 1, indicating that the disease is again entering an expansionary phase in the country. "
"The reproduction rate had fallen to about 0.7 in May, the peak of the second wave, when lockdown measures helped slow the spread of the more infectious Delta variant."
"But with restrictions eased and business activity bouncing back towards pre-pandemic levels, India  s average daily confirmed cases rose 6 per cent, to 40,460 cases per day, in the week ending Aug 1. VK Paul, the head of the Covid-19 task force, warned that the increasing reproduction rate was  truly a matter of concern  and said it was an important reminder that the pandemic was still  raging ."
"Brian Wahl, a New Delhi-based epidemiologist for Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said the escalating infection numbers could still be contained. "
"Case are increasing and it could be the beginning of a third wave. However nothing is yet written in stone,  he told the Financial Times.  This should be a call for people to mask up, to minimise social interactions if they can and to get vaccinated.  lthough experts consider a third wave almost inevitable, many believe it will not hit India as hard as the catastrophic previous outbreak unless a more virulent variant emerges. Recommended India Stories from inside India  s Covid disaster:"
"The coastal state of Kerala has been the hardest hit, with 23,676 new infections reported on Tuesday and a test positivity rate of almost 12 per cent. The recent national seroprevalence study found that just 44 per cent of people in Kerala had been exposed to the virus, far below the national average, which has left a greater portion of residents susceptible to infection."
"No one has seen anything like this   A seroprevalence study last month by the Indian Council of Medical Research found that about two-thirds of Indians aged over six already had antibodies from exposure to the virus.  Under the current circumstances, there is a high likelihood of a third wave but it would be most likely of less intensity than the second wave,  Wahl said.  The big wild card is the emergence of a new variant with immune escape potential.  "
"The uptick in infections has been concentrated in eight regions, many popular tourist destinations that have attracted a surge of visitors since lockdown was eased, including Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir."
"But experts warned that cases in other states with poorer testing infrastructure may also be surging undetected. India is administering about 4.8m Covid-19 jabs a day. Just less than 8 per cent of the population is fully vaccinated and 27 per cent have received at least one dose. Although demand for shots is high, the pace of vaccination has been hampered by a scarcity of jabs.

A wave in a pandemic is not a specialised phenomenon. The outbreak is measured in waves as and when the number of cases start rising after a long period of lull which gives the illusion that the infection has receded. The same happened in March-April this year.
"Today, on June 8, India  s case toll stood at over 28.9 million cases as it recorded 86,498 new cases in the 24 hours ending 8 am.

"It has been said that children will be infected the most in the third wave but the Pediatrics Association has said that this is not based on facts. It might not impact children so people should not fear,  said Guleria.

Speaking to PTI, experts said that while it  s necessary to lift some restrictions to resume economic activities, people must not lower their guards yet. With a steady decline in daily infections in the last few weeks, several states have started easing stringent Covid curbs imposed during the second wave. "
Third wave unlikely to be as severe as second  
"Dr Jugal Kishore, head of the Community Medicine department, Safdarjung Hospital, said a second wave-like spike is not expected unless a new variant emerges.  The Delta variant of coronavirus was responsible for up to 60 per cent of the cases during the second wave. We haven  t observed any major difference between   Delta   and   Delta Plus   variant. So, a sudden spike in Covid-19 cases is not expected, until a new, more infectious variant emerges, "
"he said. Still, there is a percentage of people who have not been infected or did not develop enough antibodies despite getting vaccinated, due to various reasons. This set of people, which is almost 30 per cent of the population in Delhi, is likely to get infected. Dr Kishore said there are two scenarios that are likely to play out based on the present situation."
"First, the virus continues to infect people slowly until herd immunity is attained, and second, a new, more infectious variant leads to an increase in cases till everyone has immunity. But it seems the third wave won  t be as severe as the second,  he said."
"There is also a possibility that a new variant bypasses the immunity achieved through vaccination and previous infection. If that happens, it will a huge problem, Dr Kishore told PTI. Earlier this month, Dr Samiran Panda of the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) had also said that a third wave is unlikely to be a destructive as the second one. "
"He had mentioned that a substantial third wave would be plausible if any new, more infectious variant of the coronavirus emerges and escapes prior immunity in the absence of adequate lockdown measures. Dr Panda had suggested that vaccination efforts be ramped up to strongly mitigate the impact of a possible third wave.   "
"Guarded approach needed   Dr Yudhyavir Singh, who has been managing the Covid-19 ICU at AIIMS New Delhi, said it is important to lift a few restrictions to resume economic activities when cases are low.  However, one should not lower their guard ... Adopt a guarded approach in terms of following Covid-19-appropriate behaviour and implementing restrictive measures,  he said."
"Dr Singh added that cites like Delhi may have already achieved herd immunity, considering the massive number of cases seen during the second wave.   Opening up everything not appropriate  "
" Dr Pooja Khosla, senior consultant (Department of Medicine), Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, told PTI that the second wave of the coronavirus has taught us that cases can increase suddenly.  There are warning signs from different parts of the world. In India too, a small increase in cases has been recorded. Infections can increase exponentially anytime."
"I think one should not assume anything and make all efforts to prevent a second wave-like crisis, which was a nightmare,  she said.  Opening everything is not appropriate ... everyone has been saying the third wave is a couple of days away,  Dr Khosla added. Pragya Sharma, professor (Department of Community Medicine) at the Maulana Azad Medical College, said a third wave is a certain thing but the number of people it will infect will depend on the implementation of preventive measures and the pace of vaccination. "
"Even if there are breakthrough infections among vaccinated people, the severity will be less and hospitals will not be overwhelmed,  she said. Sharma thinks the implementation of preventive and restrictive measures is an issue.  People either don  t wear mask or don  t wear it properly. Most of them use cloth mask, which doesn  t serve any purpose."
"There is hardly any vigil being maintained in crowded areas,  she said. After a devastating second wave of the coronavirus, people had started taking vaccination seriously. There would be queues at vaccination centres, but things have changed again. There is laxity on the part of the people, Dr Sharma said.  At the inoculation centre at MAMC, only around 50 people are getting vaccinated a day, while we can vaccinate around 200 people every day. Vaccines are available but people are not coming forward,  she said.   "
"Increase vaccination   Meanwhile, in a bid to curtail a possible third wave of Covid, an expert panel has urged the government to increase the pace of vaccination and stick to non-pharmacological interventions."
"Speaking to ANI, one of the experts in the government-authorised panel suggested it has recommended government to increase vaccination and stick to non-pharmacological interventions such as Covid-19 appropriate behaviour, wearing mask, social distancing and containment zone.  As per the panel  s recommendations, the key is to strengthen health infrastructure and prepare adequately so that up to 4 lakh cases every day can be handled. In addition, routine services are also to be maintained, they said.  "
"This will need 2 lakh additional ICU beds with 1 lakh ventilator beds. This will be in addition to vaccinations and Covid appropriate behaviour,  sources told ANI. With daily vaccinations continuing to flag and the effective reproduction rate (R) value crossing 1 for the first time since February, several modelling projections, including by experts within the government, now suggest India could be headed for a third Covid-19 peak somewhere around October-November. A modelling projection by the University of Michigan shows that India is headed for a  small bump   towards the end of August, but the next peak is likely to hit around November.  "
"Bhramar Mukherjee, the John D. Kalbfleisch Collegiate Professor of Biostatistics at the Michigan University, told ThePrint:  I am skeptical about the long range predictions of these forecasting models as things change rapidly depending on our actions and policy measures. Our models indicated that India would hit a trough in July.   She added:  Our models currently predict that the infections are now likely to be rising again with a small bump, and not a towering peak towards the end of this month (August). "
"But the more prominent third wave peak appears to be on the horizon some time around November.   Mukherjee, who is currently in India, said that she chose to travel to India in July instead of her usual practice of end-August before the start of the fall session, based on her own modelling predictions. Her team in Michigan monitors the week-on-week relative rate of change of cases, rather than just the absolute numbers, to plot trends. They had predicted an imminent second wave in India in February. "

Mukherjee dismisses concerns Mukherjee is dismissive of the speculation about the third wave hitting children the most given that India is yet to roll out Covid-19 vaccinations for them.  
"Frankly I am intrigued by the discussion in India about the third wave hitting children the worst. Sero surveys indicate young adults also have substantial seroprevalence, but reports of severity in children are rare worldwide. Children and adolescents do seem to have milder manifestations of the disease,   she said.  Nonetheless, 40 per cent of Indian population is in the age group 0-18 years, with no vaccines available for them yet. We should proactively pursue vaccination options for this age group,   "
"she added. But she is concerned about the pace of vaccination among adults too.  What is needed right now is a significant increase in vaccinations so that by the time the numbers start rising again, there is a reasonable amount of protection available at the population level, so the rise in hospitalisations is minimal,   Mukherjee added. "
"India has been administering less than 40 lakh doses per day through July and August. In the last 24 hours, 17,06,598 vaccine dosesm were administered.  For the month of August, 15 crore vaccine doses will be available, the Government of India has said, which means that anything more than 50 lakh doses per day is still some way off. "
"This is a far cry from the government  s target of one crore vaccine doses per day, which the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) Director General Dr Balram Bhargava had said would be available by mid-July. Convergence among models Mukherjee  s prediction is along the lines of what researchers from Indian Institute of Technology (IIT)-Kanpur and IIT-Hyderabad have also predicted. Officials in the Union Ministry of Health and Family Welfare said internal modelling estimates also suggest that there is likely to be something of a lull period till October when numbers start rising again.  A senior ministry official told ThePrint:  "
"There will be a plateauing and eventual fall in numbers now but the real rise will probably start happening by October. This is because the antibody levels as indicated by the recent sero survey, will start waning by then and the virus too will mutate. Asked about the pace of vaccinations, the official said:  We are on it but we are hoping that by September-October we will have sufficient numbers coming in. We expect a significant spurt in supplies and mark my words, we will be in a situation when there will be more vaccines than people willing to take them.   An organisation of top Indian doctors has warned that a third wave of Covid is inevitable as travel restrictions ease across the country. Photos and videos of tourists flocking to popular destinations have gone viral in recent days. ideos show that most of them are not wearing masks or maintaining social distancing in public places. "
"Daily new cases in India have fallen to just over 40,000 in recent weeks, down from the peaks of 400,000 in May. The drop in numbers has largely been attributed to strict lockdowns by states which are now being eased. But even as cases are declining, experts worry India could be at the risk of a potential third wave of infections as just over 6% of the eligible population has been fully vaccinated and around 22% have received at least one dose. The Indian Medical Association (IMA), an organisation that represents doctors in India, "
"on Monday said it was ""painful to note that both the government and public are complacent and are holding mass gatherings without following Covid protocols"". ""Tourist bonanza, pilgrimage travel, religious fervour are all needed, but can wait for few more months,"" the IMA said."
"It added that opening up these destinations and letting unvaccinated people congregate in these large gatherings are ""potential super spreaders for the Covid third wave"". "
"As India emerges out of a deadly second wave - that saw overwhelmed hospitals and crematoriums overflowing with the dead - several states have opened up to allow tourists and religious gatherings. But experts worry about the repercussions of these gatherings. Naga Sadhus (Hindu holy men) take a holy dip in the waters of the Ganges River on the day of Shahi Snan (royal bath) during the ongoing religious Kumbh Mela festival, in Haridwar on April 12, 2021. image captionExperts fear large religious gatherings could could act as Covid ""super spreaders"" In April, millions gathered in the Himalayan town of Haridwar to participate in the Kumbh Mela festival even as several cities grappled with a severe shortage of oxygen and hospital beds. Several of the returnees – "
"who came from all parts of the country - tested positive in the following days. Now, authorities in Uttar Pradesh state are gearing up to hold the annual Kanwar Yatra festival from 25 July. Experts say that India needs to enforce safety protocols strictly and further speed up the pace of vaccination to avoid a third wave. India is vaccinating around four million people every day, but it needs to reach 8-9 million per day to reach its target of vaccinating everyone above the age of 18 by the end of this year."
"Some states are also grappling with shortages. On Tuesday, several public vaccine centres in Delhi were closed after they ran out of jabs. The coronavirus pandemic has been center stage in India  s public discourse since March 2020 when the country saw the first lockdown being imposed. Till July 9, India had officially reported a cumulative 30.7 million cases of Covid-19 with more than 400,000 deaths. "
"The months of April and May saw India face a brutal second wave of the coronavirus pandemic. At its peak, India saw more than 400,000 new cases of Covid-19 every day with more than 4,000 daily deaths reported during this period. "
"Even as experts debate the actual number of cases or deaths in the country in this wave, speculation is rife about the timing and magnitude of a third wave of the pandemic in India. Before we look at the chances of a third wave of the Covid-19 pandemic in India, let us take stock of where we stand. With the peak of the second wave well and truly behind us, "
"there is a possibility of people assuming that the pandemic is now over. Nothing could be farther from the truth, and a closer look at data can help disabuse us of this notion. India continues to report roughly 40,000 new cases of Covid-19 every day even now. While this number is barely 10% of the peak seen in May 2021, it is still high. It is true that north, and central India are reporting fewer incidences of coronavirus infection now but west, south, and north-east India are still reporting high numbers daily. A more worrying sign is the rising number of active cases over the last month as seen in Figure 1. "
"With the economy opening up, this ought to be of concern to us. Active Covid-19 cases in India.CEDA Active Covid-19 cases in India. India has a decent test positivity ratio of 2.2%, "
but we must strive to bring it under 1%. The pace of vaccinations which seemed to be on an upswing two weeks ago has also slackened since (Figure 2). India has administered at least one dose to 22.4% of the population till July 9 while only 5.3% has been fully vaccinated 
"yet. Covid-19 vaccines administered per day in India.CEDA Covid-19 vaccines administered per day in India. With that snapshot of the present status of the pandemic in the country, let us now take a closer look at reasons behind the second wave. The second wave of the coronavirus pandemic can be attributed to the perfect storm created by four factors coming together. These are: After hitting a peak of 97,860 cases on 16 September 2020, the first wave had hit the bottom by December. "
"As the count of new cases reported continued to go down in January, and February 2021, it induced a sense of complacency at the individual, government, and policy mechanism levels. Even as a complacent public and government let their guard down, India was seeing crowded events like the Kumbh Mela being organised. Some Indian states also had high political activity in the form of crowded public rallies as they prepared for assembly elections. Moreover, it was also the time for weddings across the country. In hindsight, we can say that the Kumbh Mela and the assembly elections proved to be super spreader events. "
"While large crowds were gathering at these events, India also faced two highly infectious variants of the coronavirus, Alpha, and Delta. In the second wave we also saw the fraction of Delta variant in the population rising. Between early March and the end of May, the Delta variant became the dominant variant. With such a cocktail of factors present, it did not help that India had very low vaccine coverage by February end. Only about 4.2 million doses of the vaccine had been administered till then, "
covering only 0.3% of India  s population with one dose. These four factors came together and led to the dangerous second wave of the pandemic in the country. Is a third wave coming? Figure 3 compares the daily reported cases in the top 10 most affected countries in the world. The first thing we notice when we look at the graphs is that there is no uniform pattern across countries. 
"While some countries clearly show multiple waves, others don  t with daily infections remaining high (like Brazil, and Colombia). In countries that show multiple waves (US, UK, Turkey), the gap between peaks is also not uniform. This is understandable since local dynamics in each country influence this. Daily Covid-19 cases in the world&#039;s most affected countries.CEDA Daily Covid-19 cases in the world  s most affected countries. Figure 3 tells us that different countries behave differently. "
"Based on what we have seen in other countries, it would be hard to predict whether India will see a third wave or not, when it will appear, or if it will appear at all. Three factors will determine the timing and magnitude of future waves in the country. Individual choices Vaccination coverage Variants Will people continue to wear masks, practice social distancing, and avoid crowds or will India see a return of the kind of behavior seen in the second wave when super spreader events saw large crowds? "
"Such individual choices will determine the timing and the strength of a future wave of the pandemic. India has administered 369 million vaccine doses so far (till 9 July 2021) providing single dose coverage to more than 22.4% and full coverage to just 5.3% Indians. Will we be able to cover a much more substantial number with both doses of the vaccine by October? The second wave was a result of more infectious variants like Alpha and Delta appearing in the country. Will we see more infectious variants in the future? While (1) is based on individual choices, (2) is based on public policy, and (3) is a random process. But even (3) can be controlled by (1) and (2). If we can reduce transmission by appropriate individual behaviour and higher vaccination numbers, "
"we can reduce virus circulation and multiplication. This will reduce the chances of random mutations that lead to virus variants. That means people in India will need to stay alert and careful, follow safe behaviour protocols, and be especially alert during the festive period of October-November this year. People who were exposed to Covid-19 in the first wave would also show a significant waning of antibodies by then. Current data suggests that they would still get infected, but would be protected from severe disease, hospitalisation, and mortality. hile we must stay alert and prepare for a third wave, we must also remember that smart individual choices, and smarter public policy can help ward off the danger that any wave may pose in the future. Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria has said that India may witness a third wave of COVID-19 in September-October. "
"The eminent pulmonologist had some good news to share as he expected the possible future wave of coronavirus may be less severe than the second as the Indian Council of Medical Research  s 4th national Covid sero survey has found that two-thirds of the country  s population aged above six to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and also the vaccination drive is going on in a large scale. Speaking exclusively to CNN-News18, Dr Guleria said that with states gradually lifting the lockdown-like restrictions and people not following the COVID-19 protocols as it should be, the possibility of a third wave hitting the country is most likely in September-October.

He further stressed that serosurvey and some other studies have also found that 50-60 per cent have developed anti-bodies. The AIIMS director said that the Bharat Biotech vaccine and the Zydus Cadila vaccine for children may be available soon. Dr Guleria said as Zydus has completed its trials, it is most likely to be launched in September. "

"India  s surveillance system has improved majorly after the second wave of coronavirus. This can help the country deal better with the new variants of the deadly virus.

""We are now hopefully getting past our [Covid-19] pandemic... and the economic activities will be strengthened as we get into the second half of this (fiscal) year given what I have seen for example various indicators, including the mobility indicators,"" said NITI Aayog Vice-Chairman Rajiv Kumar. "
"Preparing For The Third Wave In India At the moment we are seeing a resurgence in the Covid cases in the USA and in the UK we recently had a spike in cases. How threatening is it for India and how is the country preparing for the third wave? Let  s hear it from the experts. Is India really going to face the third wave? ""What we have seen in the second wave is that the virus can hit us very hard and this is only because of the deadly mutations in the virus. So these mutations are normal and are going to happen for the SARS Cov2 as well. Therefore yes, there is a strong chance for India to face the third wave,"" said Dr. Baghel, Consultant, SL Raheja Hospital. ""The best way to tackle the third wave in India is to get vaccinated as early as possible, "
"said Dr. Pandit, Director Fortis Hospital. The other things to keep in mind according to the experts is to maintain proper Covid behaviour which includes social distancing, wearing masks, and alertness. India is prepared to face the third wave but everyone needs to understand that to defeat the virus one needs to follow proper protocols. And some administrative decisions are also required to be introduced. What are the administrative initiatives that can be taken? ""It is easier said than done. "
"The best way to stop the spread is by putting a micro lockdown. However, here are some of the things that the administration should implement right now are:"
"Impose strict lockdown if your area  s test positivity rate is higher than normal which is 5%. The second one is vaccination. The vaccination drive is slow, the country is not able to vaccinate the entire population. The third being the available infrastructure in your district or state is getting stretched because of the number of cases coming positive. "
"All of these three things need to be taken into consideration in order to tackle the third wave better. COVID-19 Is Not Over Yet, Do Not Let Your Guard Down ""We all have seen how deadly the second wave was and to avert the same thing happening again in the country, we have increased our vaccination drive across the states, we have better Covid management system which will help us achieve herd immunity against the virus,"" the experts said. Is India really ready what should one be doing? While the second wave appears to be gradually receding, experts have warned that the third Covid wave is imminent and inevitable. And so, even after vaccination, it is advisable to continue taking all precautions like wearing a mask, staying 6 feet apart from others, "
"and avoiding crowds. Director of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) Dr Randeep Guleria has said that India may witness a third wave of COVID-19 in September-October. The eminent pulmonologist had some good news to share as he expected the possible future wave of coronavirus may be less severe than the second as the Indian Council of Medical Research  s 4th national Covid sero survey has found that two-thirds of the country  s population aged above six to have SARS-CoV-2 antibodies and also the vaccination drive is going on in a large scale.

"The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has projected that the third wave is likely to hit India by the end of August and said that it isn  t inevitable. Scientists are racing to prepare for and mathematically model the possibility of a third wave of COVID-19 infections in India, which by most accounts may not be as devastating as the second wave that peaked in May 2021. Epidemiologists are keenly studying local breakout of infection in some states of the country and trying to figure if it may signal the advent of a third wave. Efforts are on to estimate the scale of an impending wave, defined by increased number of infections across the country. On this alone, there is a meeting of views. The third wave is likely to be more localised, if and whenever it starts.  "
"In the first and second waves, reported numbers were a reflection of the national trend. But in the third wave we have to look at state-level granularity,   says Samiran Panda, head and chief of epidemiology and infectious diseases at the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Given that over 80% of infections were now confined to about 10 states, says Panda, a third wave in some states should not be inferred as a country-wide wave. ""We need to analyse state-level data with more accuracy.   "
"Small spikes in parts of Kerala and Maharashtra  cannot be seen to indicate an impending third wave at this point of time,   agrees Tarun Bhatnagar, senior scientist at the ICMR-National Institute of Epidemiology in Chennai. Pointing to the  blips in some states, of late  , the third wave, Panda says, should be assessed keeping in mind the  heterogeneity of states  . "
"Rising local numbers  At the moment, what is happening in Maharashtra (numbers have hit a plateau) and Kerala (growing numbers) might signal a third wave in those states  , explains Gautam Menon, mathematical modeller and professor of physics and biology at Ashoka University in Sonepat near Delhi. Menon says a likely inference is that the infection has already  burned through   a large section of the susceptible population during the first and second waves. The All India Institute of Medical Sciences and World Health Organization (WHO) reported high sero-positivity in a recent survey, suggesting 67 percent of adult population in India was already exposed to the virus. The high numbers in Kerala can be explained in the context of exposure to infection.  "
"Serological studies for Kerala indicate that a relatively smaller fraction of the population may have sustained a prior infection compared to the rest of India. So there may still be a reservoir of susceptible people to be infected there,   says Menon. "
"A surge in cases now would be because the population is not yet exposed to the virus either through natural symptomatic or asymptomatic infection or vaccination, says Bhatnagar. Barring in the northeast states of India, cases are reducing consistently accompanied by low test positivity rates. District-level monitoring of the trend of new cases and test positivity over at least a two-week period can be a good barometer of a sustained rise or fall in cases and potential emergence of the third wave, suggests Bhatnagar."
"Scientists reiterate the need to prioritise the tracking of positivity rate and vaccination. Mandal says,  Vaccination has to be prioritised, especially in areas with high positivity rate.    It is likely we will keep seeing outbreaks with differing local contributory factors and trajectories, such as what we are seeing currently in the northeast, in Kerala and in Maharashtra  , says Satyajit Rath, immunologist at Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Pune. What influences a wave? The three things that scientists say will drive a third wave are highly infectious new variants, free movement and crowding of people and large numbers of unvaccinated people. Pandemic fatigue among people and governments, emergence of more transmissible variants and slow uneven pace of vaccination explain why COVID-19 infection has been more widespread this year compared to 2020, says Rath. "
"A possible third wave can be precipitated by waning immunity among people, emergence of a more transmissible variant and relaxations by governments in lockdown curbs, Randeep Guleria, AIIMS director, was similarly quoted as saying. WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyes has warned that the COVID-19 pandemic is now in the early stage of the third wave. As states prepare for a third wave, the Indian government too has said the next two to three months are crucial. The worry stems from the fact that vaccination rates remain tardy and COVID-19 protocols in public are barely adhered to. Dr Brian Wahl, epidemiologist and faculty at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health says,  Most models for COVID-19 that look beyond two or so weeks rely heavily on assumptions of vaccination rates and levels of physical and social distancing.   "
"Wahl says some of the models that predict a third wave have  assumed current vaccination rates and non pharmaceutical interventions like physical distancing and mask wearing.   K Srinath Reddy, president of the Public Health Foundation of India says a third wave is expected anywhere between August and October.  If we follow COVID-19 appropriate behaviour and prevent super-spreader events, we can limit it to a ripple rather than a tidal wave. If we are lax, we will suffer a severe surge.   While the number of people susceptible to the virus will be less than those at the beginning of the second wave, many are still vulnerable. This will play a role if the  third wave comes in August. By October, many more will be vaccinated,   he says. Vaccination key Vaccination is key to influencing the severity of a wave. Mathematical models have shown vaccination can help flatten the third wave, says Panda.  "
"We should understand that the second wave has not vanished. Ramping up vaccination can reduce severity of the disease to a large extent,   he says. Wahl echoes this. Increasing vaccination and adhering to COVID-19-appropriate behaviour can help either prevent or mitigate a third wave.  We have seen this in our models. All the more important in the context of a more transmissible Delta variant.  "
"India vaccinated 8.6 million on June 21, its highest number of daily inoculations against COVID-19. Numbers have been steadily declining since. Barely 6% of its population is fully vaccinated.  Focus should be on vaccinating around 10 million people per month and addressing vaccine hesitancy,   says Bhatnagar.  If majority are not yet vaccinated then there is a high probability that the infection rate will go up,   says Polly Roy, professor of virology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. "
"How severe will the next wave be? A third wave of COVID-19 in India is unlikely to be as severe as the second wave given the extent of spread of the virus, according to an ICMR modelling study1. The study reviewed data with assumptions to see the impact of various levels of waning of existing immunity. The modellers examined four factors – waning immunity without any change in the virus, emergence of a new virus variant capable of escaping pre-existing immunity, emergence of a more transmissible variant without loss of immunity to previously circulating strains and fresh opportunities for transmission afforded by relaxation of local restrictive measures (lockdowns). Immune-mediated mechanisms — waning immunity or viral evolution for immune escape — are unlikely to drive a severe third wave if acting on their own, unless such mechanisms lead to a complete loss of protection among those previously exposed, the study notes. Likewise, a new, more transmissible variant would have to exceed a high threshold (R0 >4.5) to cause a third wave on its own, it suggests. Bhatnagar,"
"however, says that genetic sequencing must be used at a large scale to examine the spectrum of variants. Mandal and colleagues have also recommended measures to take the vaccination drive closer to the people at the community level2. They suggest creating satellite vaccination centres near rural hamlets and urban resident welfare associations, "
"converting community halls and using large parking spaces for drive-in vaccination, and using mobile vaccination facilities to cover populations who cannot access vaccination centres easily. India may see another rise in Covid-19 cases as soon as August with the third wave peaking with less than 100,000 infections a day in the best-case scenario or nearly 150,000 in the worst scenario, researchers have said. Bloomberg reported citing researchers "
"led by Mathukumalli Vidyasagar and Manindra Agrawal at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Hyderabad and Kanpur respectively that the surge in Covid-19 cases will push the third wave of the coronavirus pandemic, "
"which may peak in October. Vidyasagar told Bloomberg in an email that states with high Covid-19 cases, such as Kerala and Maharashtra, could  skew the picture.  "
"The third wave is unlikely to be as brutal as the second wave when India reported 400,000-plus daily cases and came down after that. The prediction by the researchers, who accurately forecast the lessening of the surge in Covid-19 cases earlier this year, "
"is based on a mathematical model. In May, Vidyasagar, a professor at IIT Hyderabad said India  s coronavirus outbreak could peak in the coming days based on the mathematical model.  Our predictions are that the peak will come within a few days. As per current projections, we should hit 20,000 cases per day by the end of June. We will revise this as needed,"" Vidyasagar told Bloomberg by email. However, in April, Vidyasagar  s team  s prediction that the wave would peak by the middle of last month was incorrect. He wrote on Twitter at the time that it was because of incorrect parameters as  the pandemic was changing rapidly, even wildly, "
"until about a week ago."" He also told Reuters that the peak would be between May 3-5 and to India Today that it would come on May 7. India reported 41,831 Covid-19 cases and 541 deaths on Sunday even as the Centre cautioned 10 states, including Kerala, Maharashtra and northeastern regions, "
amid the rising infections and asked them to take steps to arrest the spread of the coronavirus. 
"Experts have also warned that the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which spreads as easily as chickenpox and can be passed on by vaccinated people, can fuel the surge. According to data from the Indian Sars-CoV-2 Genomic Consortium (INSACOG), nearly 8 of every 10 Covid-19 cases in May, "
"June and July were caused by the highly infectious Delta variant of the coronavirus. Hours after the World Health Organisation announced that the world was already in the early stages of the third wave of Covid-19, "
"the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has projected that the third wave is likely to hit India by the end of August. Dr Samiran Panda, Head of Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases at ICMR said that the third wave is likely to not be as intense as the second wave. The doctor, however, said that while both Delta and Delta Plus variants had spread across the country, the variants are not expected to cause any further ""public health havoc"", NDTV reported.  "
"On Thursday, AIIMS Director Randeep Guleria also spoke about the third wave of Covid-19 and outlines four factors that could lead to the wave. "
"These include waning immunity, the emergence of a more transmissible coronavirus variant capable of escaping the immunity shield and lockdown relaxations can be the likely causes of a possible third wave of COVID-19. Speaking at an event, he said the third wave can be mitigated by following Covid-appropriate behaviour such as maintaining social distancing, using masks, and taking vaccine."
He said several studies and modelling have been conducted to project the trajectory of a possible third wave of the pandemic under different scenarios. 
"""One such model from an IIT shows that if all restrictions are lifted and if a virus (variant) is also able to escape immunity then the next wave can be bigger than the second wave. ""If some restrictions are kept and the virus also remains stable then cases will not be much and if we keep more restrictions then cases will further reduce,"" he said. Guleria said even if new variants emerge, the available vaccines can be tweaked. Guleria said the third wave of COVID-19 is being seen in other countries but hospitalisation has come down, indicating that the vaccines are working. Listing possible reasons that can precipitate the third wave, "
"Guleria said waning immunity -- which restores previously exposed individuals to a susceptible state -- the emergence of a new more transmissible variant of the virus capable of escaping immunity, and relaxation of current lockdowns can be the likely causes. He said that apart from Covaxin, Covishield and Sputnik V, several other vaccines are in the pipeline in the country.  "
"The Delta variant, which was first found in India, has now been found in over 111 countries across the world.  ICMR  s predictions come hours after WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus announced that the world was already in the ""early stages"" of the third phase of the pandemic.  It also comes days after the Indian Medical Association (IMA) called pilgrimage and tourism as potential super spreaders for the third wave of Covid 19 and warned states to stop mass gatherings. he worst fears might just come true, sooner than anticipated. A study conducted by IIT researchers has predicted arrival of Covid19 third wave this month itself. The third wave of Covid-19 is likely to hit India in the month of August, the study reveals. According to the findings, the daily infection tally may range between 1 lakh to 1.5 lakh in the country during Wave-3. This is however far less than the second wave which saw more than 4 lakh cases daily over a period. This study was conducted by Mathukumalli Vidyasagar and Manindra Agrawal at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) in Hyderabad and Kanpur. The research also forecast that the third wave may peak in the month of October this year. "
"Speaking to media, Mathukumalli Vidyasagar said that the states with high COVID-19 cases such as Kerala and Maharashtra could   skew the picture  . Currently, India is reporting nearly 40,000 daily COVID cases with Kerala being the biggest contributor to the tally. On Monday, India reported 40,134 cases of COVID-19.
